# Reactive Playground

Before we dive into the spring cloud gateway, you have the chance to get a first glimpse on the difference between imperative and reactive programming style.
To do this we will look into the project `reactive-playground`.

The following resources might be helpful for first steps into the reactive world:

* [Project Reactor Reference Documentation](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/)

* [Which operator do I need?](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#which-operator)

This playground contains a starting point to play around with the reactive stuff.  
Just execute tests in the class `BasicReactivePlaygroundTests` to learn more about the reactive streams api.

If you want to learn more about the project reactor and reactive streams you may also want to check another GitHub repository for a [Reactive Spring Security 5 Workshop](https://github.com/andifalk/reactive-spring-security-5-workshop).
